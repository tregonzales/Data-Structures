To run UseBankSim, in the input file the numbers are structured as follows:
Customer arrival time
transaction time
customer arrival time
transaction time

So if you would like to test it using different numbers, adjust the file “bank.txt” in such fashion.  Simply a BankSim object is made with the parameter being the file name.
